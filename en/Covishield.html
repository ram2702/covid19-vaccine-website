            The University of Oxford partnered with AstraZeneca company to develop a vaccine
            called Covishield on January 3<sup>rd</sup>. A clinical trial revealed the vaccine was 62 to 90
            percent effective, depending on the initial dosage.
            <br> <br>
            &emsp; The coronavirus is studded with proteins that it uses to enter human cells.
            These so-called spike proteins make a tempting target for
            potential vaccines and treatments.The Oxford vaccine uses double-stranded
            DNA rather than the single stranded RNA used in other Covid 19
            vaccines,thus the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for Covid-19 is more rugged
            than the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.
            The researchers added the gene for the coronavirus spike protein to another
            virus called an adenovirus. Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically
            cause colds or flu-like symptoms.Here a modified version of a chimpanzee
            adenovirus, known as ChAdOx1 is used.It can enter cells, but it can’t replicate
            inside them.<br> <br>
            &emsp;
            After the vaccine is injected into a person’s arm, the adenoviruses bump into
            cells and latch onto proteins on their surface. The cell engulfs the virus in a
            bubble and pulls it inside. Once inside, the adenovirus escapes from the
            bubble and travels to the nucleus, the chamber where the cell’s DNA is
            stored.The adenovirus pushes its DNA into the nucleus where the gene for
            the coronavirus spike protein can be read by the cell and copied into a
            molecule called messenger RNA, or mRNA.The mRNA leaves the nucleus,
            and the cell’s molecules read its sequence and begin assembling spike
            proteins.These spike protein fragments leave the cells and can then be
            recognized by the immune system.Spike protein fragments are taken up by a
            type of immune cell called an antigen-presenting cell. When other cells called
            helper T cells detect the presence of these fragments on antigen-presenting
            cells, the helper T cells signals other immune cells to fight the infection.
            Other immune cells, called B cells, may bump into the coronavirus spikes on
            the surface of vaccinated cells, or free-floating spike protein fragments.If
            these B cells are then activated by helper T cells, they will start to proliferate
            and pour out antibodies that target the spike protein.
            These antibodies are able to prevent infection from active coronavirus by
            blocking its protein spikes from attaching to other cells. <br>
            <br> &emsp;The antigen-presenting cells can also activate another type of immune cell called a killer T cell to seek
            out and destroy any coronavirus-infected cells that display the spike protein
            fragments on their surfaces.
            The covishield vaccine requires two doses, given four weeks apart, to prime
            the immune system to fight off the coronavirus.
