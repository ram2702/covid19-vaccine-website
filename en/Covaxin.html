        The Indian company Bharat Biotech partnered with the National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research to develop an inactivated coronavirus vaccine called Covaxin.
To create Covaxin, Bharat Biotech used a sample of the coronavirus isolated by Indiaâ€™s National Institute of Virology.Covaxin is a vaccine made from Coronavirus itself.
Covaxin works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.The vaccine is prepared by deactivating the genes of the coronavirus by dosing them with chemicals and killing the virus.Thus inactivated coronaviruses could no longer replicate. But their proteins, including spike, remained intact.Because the coronaviruses in Covaxin are dead, they can be injected into the arm without causing Covid-19. Once inside the body, some of the inactivated viruses are swallowed up by a type of immune cell called an antigen-presenting cell.The antigen-presenting cell tears the coronavirus apart and displays some of its fragments on its surface. A so-called helper T cell may detect the fragment and can help recruit other immune cells to respond to the vaccine.Another type of immune cell, called a B cell, may also encounter the inactivated coronavirus.If this B cell comes in contact with a activated helper T cell, then the B cell starts to pour out antibodies capable of preventing the virus from entering human cells.
 Once vaccinated with Covaxin, the immune system can respond to an infection of live coronaviruses.
 Covaxin is being tested in two doses, given four weeks apart
