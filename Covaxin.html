The Indian company Bharat Biotech partnered with the National Institute of
Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research to develop an inactivated
coronavirus vaccine called Covaxin.To create Covaxin, Bharat Biotech used
a sample of the coronavirus isolated by Indiaâ€™s National Institute of
Virology.Covaxin is a vaccine made from Coronavirus itself.Covaxin works by
teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus.The coronavirus genes are disabled by dosing them with
chemicals and killing the virus.Thus inactivated coronaviruses could no longer
replicate. But their proteins, including spike, remained intact.Because the
coronaviruses in Covaxin are dead, they can be injected into the arm without
causing Covid-19. Once inside the body, some of the inactivated viruses are
swallowed up by a type of immune cell called an antigen-presenting cell which
releases antibodies to fight the virus.Once vaccinated with Covaxin, the
immune system can respond to an infection of live coronaviruses. Covaxin is
being tested in two doses, given four weeks apart.
